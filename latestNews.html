          The former prime minister of Malaysia made a controversial statement that surprised Singaporean and Indonesian netizens. Mahathir Mohammad, in his
          speech on June 19 2022 at a right-wing organization event held in Selangor City, said that the Malay people had been patient for too long by not
          demanding their rights. One example, said the 96-year-old politician, is the magnanimity of the Malay people who until now have not claimed the
          territory of Singapore and the Riau Archipelago, even though historically they have ruled there.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
          "Shouldn't we just demand that Pedra Branca or Batu Puteh Island be returned to us, we should also demand Singapore and the Riau Archipelago, because
          those areas are actually Malay Land," Mahathir said, to applause from the audience, as reported by the Straits Times.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
          Mahathir, whose current status is a member of parliament representing the state of Langkawi, thinks that many Malays, or Bumiputera in Malaysia, are
          not aware of the greatness of their ethnic history. According to him, the land belonging to the Malay people centuries ago was very broad, stretching
          from the Isthmus of Kra in southern Thailand to the Riau Archipelago, and including Singapore. But now, the Malay territory is limited to the Malay
          Peninsula and northern Borneo.
        </p>

        <p class="desc">"I wonder whether the Malay Peninsula will one day belong to someone else," he said.</p>
        <p class="desc">
          Deputy V of the Presidential Staff Office, Jaleswari Pramodawardhani, assessed that the people in the country should not rush to be provoked by the
          elderly politician's statement. This is because these comments do not necessarily reflect the political position of the Malaysian government, which is
          now led by Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob. "If it doesn't [become the official position of the Malaysian government], then this statement is just
          a personal view," Jaleswari said when confirmed by Suara.com.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
          In a separate confirmation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also considered that the claim that the Riau Archipelago actually belongs to Malaysia, as
          Mahathir said, does not have any juridical arguments in accordance with international law. "Indonesia does not see the legal basis and reasons for Tun
          Mahathir's statement," said Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Teuku Faizasyah in a written statement.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
          The event which was attended by Mahathir entitled 'I am Malay: Survival Begins', involved several groups of NGOs and mass organizations that focused
          on resurrecting the glory of Malays. According to the Malaysia Gazzette report, Mahathir's words were not meant to provoke Singapore or Indonesia, but
          were satire against the Sultan of Johor.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
          Sang Sultan dan keluarganya tercatat beberapa kali berkonflik dengan Mahathir, serta pernah mengancam ingin lepas dari Federasi Malaysia. Mahathir
          menilai, jika memang dasar sejarah hendak dijadikan pegangan Johor merasa bisa menjadi bangsa sendiri, maka seharusnya Sultan Johor sekalian saja
          meminta pengembalian wilayah Singapura.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
          â€œHowever, there is no demand whatsoever from Singapore. On the contrary, we are showing our appreciation for the leadership of this new nation called
          Singapore," Mahathir said, referring to Malaysia's defeat which had to be willing to hand over Batu Puteh Island (aka Pedra Branca) as Singapore's
          legal territory, at the 2008 hearing at the International Court of Justice. this time, Mahathir himself, during his time as a well-known politician in
          the neighboring country, was recorded by the BBC as often making controversial statements.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
          Indonesia dan Malaysia juga pernah berkonflik soal klaim wilayah terkait Pulau Sipadan serta Ligitan. Pada sidang yang berlangsung 2002, Mahkamah
          Internasional menetapkan dua pulau di perbatasan itu merupakan wilayah Malaysia.
