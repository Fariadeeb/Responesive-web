          President Joko Widodo, through a statement that is considered historic, acknowledged that there were 12 serious human rights (HAM) incidents that had
          occurred in the past of the Republic of Indonesia. These cases never received a legal settlement until now. He made this confession after receiving a
          report from the Team for the Non-Judicial Settlement of Human Rights Violations (PPHAM) at the State Palace in Jakarta, on 11 January 2023.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
          Jokowi said he had carefully read the PPHAM report, the team that was formed based on Presidential Decree No. 17 of 2022. "With a clear mind and a
          sincere heart, I as the Head of State of the Republic of Indonesia acknowledge that gross human rights violations did occur in various incidents,"
          said Jokowi. Jokowi.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">The following are 12 gross human rights violations that Jokowi admits and regrets:</p>

        </ol>
        <p class="desc">
          Setelah adanya pengakuan ini, pemerintah akan berupaya memulihkan hak-hak korban pelanggaran HAM berat secara adil dan bijaksana. Pemulihan hak ini
          tanpa menegasikan penyelesaiaan secara yudisial.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
          Jokowi also said that the government is making serious efforts to prevent gross human rights violations from happening again in Indonesia. "Hopefully
          this effort will be a meaningful step for healing the wounds of our fellow nation's children in order to strengthen our national harmony in the
          unitary state of the Republic of Indonesia," he said.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
          In addition, President Jokowi asked the Coordinating Minister for Politics, Law and Security (Menkopolhukam), Mahfud MD, to oversee the government's
          concrete efforts so that the above matters were carried out properly.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
          In this case, Mahfud MD also serves as Chair of the PPHAM Team Steering Committee. The chairman of the PPHAM Team, namely Professor Makarim Wibisono,
          with seven other members namely Ifdal Kasim, Professor Suparman Marzuki, Dr. Mustafa Abubakar, Professor Rahayu, K.H. As'ad Said Ali, Lieutenant
          General TNI Retired. Kiki Syahnarki, and Professor Komarudin Hidayat. Mahfud MD emphasized that the PPHAM Team's work does not negate the continuation
          of the judicial process. "So this team does not close and divert the judicial settlement to a non-judicial settlement. No. The judicial ones go
          ahead," said Mahfud MD
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
          After the acknowledgment regarding this gross human rights violation, the Chairperson of the Communion of Churches in Indonesia (PGI), Gomar Gultom,
          asked the government to delete historical material that had existed so far. This material is considered as a distortion of history and obscuring the
          facts of human rights violations that have occurred.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
          Gomar also considers the need to memorialize these gross human rights violations in the form of a statute. This proposal is a warning for the next
          generation.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
          "I appreciate the sincerity of the President's acknowledgment and regret. Even though it was not accompanied by an apology, in my opinion this has
          been very advanced. In fact, with that regret, an apology is already implicit in it," said Gomar
